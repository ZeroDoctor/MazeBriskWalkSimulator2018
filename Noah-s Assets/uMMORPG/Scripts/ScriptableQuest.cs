// Saves the quest info in a ScriptableObject that can be used ingame by
// referencing it from a MonoBehaviour. It only stores an quest's static data.
//
// We also add each one to a dictionary automatically, so that all of them can
// be found by name without having to put them all in a database. Note that we
// have to put them all into the Resources folder and use Resources.LoadAll to
// load them. This is important because some quests may not be referenced by any
// entity ingame (e.g. after a special event). But all quests should still be
// loadable from the database, even if they are not referenced by anyone
// anymore. So we have to use Resources.Load. (before we added them to the dict
// in OnEnable, but that's only called for those that are referenced in the
// game. All others will be ignored be Unity.)
//
// A Quest can be created by right clicking the Resources folder and selecting
// Create -> uMMORPG Quest. Existing quests can be found in the Resources folder
